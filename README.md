My version of a to do list application that had to be created for school activities

### Main page
In the main menu of the application we have a list with tasks, a button for adding new tasks and filtering above the list. In the upper right corner there is a menu with options such as showing / hiding hidden tasks, adding and sorting by categories and sorting by deadline
